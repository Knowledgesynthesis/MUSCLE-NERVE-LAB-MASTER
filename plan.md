# **MUSCLE & NERVE LAB MASTER — OPTIMIZED MASTER PROMPT FOR EDUCATIONAL APP GENERATION**

A **mobile-first**, **dark-mode**, **offline-ready** pathology–resident educational platform covering **Muscle Biopsy Pathology + Peripheral Nerve Pathology** exactly as taught in a **neuromuscular / muscle lab / nerve lab rotation**, or in standard neuropathology/neuromuscular pathology textbooks (e.g., Dubowitz, Prayson, WHO Neuromuscular Tumors — conceptual only).

This app must include:
- Normal skeletal muscle & peripheral nerve histology (LM + special stains)  
- Muscle fiber types, patterns of injury, inflammatory myopathies  
- Dystrophies & congenital myopathies  
- Metabolic & mitochondrial myopathies  
- Neuropathies (axonal vs demyelinating)  
- Nerve biopsy patterns (onion bulbs, axonal loss, regeneration clusters)  
- Reactions of muscle to denervation/reinnervation  
- Important special stains (Gomori trichrome, NADH, COX/SDH, ATPase, oil red O, PAS)  
- IF/IHC concepts for muscle & nerve pathology (dystrophin, sarcoglycans, merosin, neurofilament)  
- Muscle lab workflow (orientation, freezing artifacts, pitfalls)  
- EM concept modules (z-line streaming, mitochondrial accumulations, inclusions)  
- Pitfalls and common mimics  
- Integrated synthetic cases with LM + special stains + IHC + EM concepts  

All imagery is **synthetic, diagrammatic**, **no real photomicrographs**, **no PHI**, **no tracking**, **educational only**.
